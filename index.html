                    <p>After working for Pfizer, our founder decided that helping patients and staff in hospitals was how she wanted to spend her time. Her love of dogs made animal-assisted therapy a perfect fit. All was on track, she had two amazing certified
                        therapy dogs and she was making a lot of volunteer visits. She was, however, having a lot of problems with the frequent bathing required by the hospital (Joint Commission requirements). A victim of Raynaud's disease, her hands
                        are incredibly sensitive to temperature and chemicals. Not only were her hands being irritated by shampooing her dogs, but her dogs' skin was, too.

He is sweet and docile in the home, yet a go-getter in the field. Fall 2011, Samson earned his UKC Upland title and AKC Master Hunter title. We are planning on taking him to the Spring Grand in 2012 and Master Nationals. Samson also has his CGC (Canine Good Citizen title) and ThD (Certified Therapy Dog title, an AKC title).

                Samson's first attempt at competing in Conformation, won 22 ribbons at the shows held in Peoria,IL early July. He just completed his UKC confirmation title in Richmond, KY.

                Samson qualified and ran in the 2012 HRC Spring Grand in Wisconsin. He had a great run and I was proud of the efforts he put forth. Though he did not finish/pass, he will be sure to make a strong comeback in the Fall of 2013 in Davenport, IA.

                Samson is qualified for the 2012 Master Nationals in Bruce, Mississippi.  Samson is also qualified and will be running 2013 Master Nationals.

                Samson will be running his first Qualifier in July 2013" data-toggle="modal" href="#dogModal">

Soon after bringing her home, she learned to be house broken, comes promptly to either her name or a whistle, brings in the newspaper to the house from the driveway end, has endless energy to retrieve bumpers or duck wings. We are very excited to have her, as she was purchased by my parents who are looking for a calm house companion and duck blind companion, yet also one that will excel in both AKC and UKC hunt tests. I believe Chloe will definitely fill these roles for them. Chloe achieved her CGC(Canine Good Citizen) title at age 10months...quite an aaccomplishment for such a young dog.  She obtained her UKC Started Hunting Retriever title (before the age of 1) and her AKC Junior title at age 1.

                Chloe, her first duck hunting season out, retrieved over 80 ducks for my father both seen and unseen (run as blinds) She also ran her first Upland hunt tests in Feb 2013 and got her title in 4/4 passes--no fails...she is a natural at whatever she does!"

                    <h2>SENSITIVE SKIN</h2>
                    <p>The problem with most shampoos is that their chemical cleansers strip and wash away the natural skin, fur, and protective oils. Many products can even leave your hands feeling rough and dry after bathing your dog. Surprisingly, a dog's
                        epidermis has fewer layers and is more delicate than human skin. For many dogs this stripping leaves the skin permeable and vulnerable and the hair weak and fragile. This results in a dull, limp coat and red, bumpy, flaky, or itchy
                        skin. Is your dog licking and scratching? Do they have hot spots? Is their coat missing that natural healthy shine?</p>
